## Notice on the Open-Source Plan Suspension

We regret to inform you that we have decided to halt our open-source plan related to the research described in our paper, _Your Exploit is Mine: Instantly Synthesizing Counterattack Smart Contract_, presented at the 32nd USENIX Security Symposium.

### Reason for Suspension

This decision has been made out of **ethical considerations**. We believe it is crucial to prioritize the responsible use of research outcomes, particularly in areas with significant security implications.
